summary: IBM Tech 2023 was a celebration event in Dubai
---

Just back from a fantastic time at #ibmtech2023 in Dubai, where it was great to meet with so many colleagues from across IBM, celebrate our achievements and learn together.

I was really struck by this in the welcome kickoff from Dinesh Nirmal - "For every ten excuses, find one reason to believe" - that technological advances come through out of belief in the possible even through surrounding skepticism. Meeting and chatting to so many fantastic IBMers shows how that belief can be reinforced through the many accomplishments being celebrated.

Then after a coffee break we had our first session - for me this was "AI Overview and IBM AI Technology Roadmap" which was a really well presented session with lots of useful information but I was starting to flag a bit after the late night arrival.

After the morning sessions we headed off to our recreation activity - mine was the 4x4 Desert Safari where we went off exploring the desert dunes in a 4x4, up the slopes and then along the edge of the peak before turning back round and down. This was followed by riding camels - it was really strange when they go up and kneel down and felt very high up on them!  After this we had the chance to try sand-boarding, which I didn't do very well at at all and the board kept burying itself in the sand and getting stuck rather than elegantly gliding down the slope as I was hoping for!

Time to refresh before the Welcome dinner where they had a buffet style meal and musicians performing in the centre.

After the dinner a group of us headed down to see the fountains in front of the Burj Khalifa.
