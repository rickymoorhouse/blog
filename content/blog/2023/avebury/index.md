We met my parents at [Avebury](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/avebury/) and spent the day exploring the ancient landscape around the area. 
Avebury is one of the best preserved Neolithic monuments in Europe and is believed to have been constructed between 3100 BC - 2000 BC. The site consists of a large henge, or circular ditch, surrounded by a stone circle, two inner circles and two additional semi-circles outside the main ring.

From there we walked along the [West Kennet Avenue](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/west-kennet-avenue/) and up over the fields.  As we reached the top, we started to see a glimpse of [Silbury Hill](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/silbury-hill/) - the largest artificial mound in Europe. We then headed down towards Silbury Hill and across to the [West Kennet Long Barrow](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/west-kennet-long-barrow/) which is a really impressive structure. As we took in the sights of the long barrow and the views all around the landscape we watched the swallows flying into the barrow to catch flies.
