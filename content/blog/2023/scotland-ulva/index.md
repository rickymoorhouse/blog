[Ulva](https://www.ulva.scot/) is a community owned island with a current population of 6 people.  The first experience visiting Ulva is the ferry which you summon using by sliding the indicator on the ferry board to show red. I didn't initially spot this, but Kai and Laura did and managed to summon the ferry for us - otherwise we'd have been waiting a long time!  This ferry is for passengers only and is a very short crossing across from Mull.

We started our visit with Sheila's cottage which gave an interesting insight into life on Ulva in the past and then a stop for coffee and cakes at the Boathouse Restaurant. We then went for a walk around the near part of the island taking in some of the sights.  It was really peaceful with only a couple of other groups of walkers we saw on the way around the island.

The tracks were good, the paths were well marked and the nature unspoilt.

As we reached the higher points on the route, there were fantastic views across to Mull and around the surrounding area.
