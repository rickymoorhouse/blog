We started the day pondering where to turn round, whether we could turn round just above the Cosgrove lock after getting water, or if we needed to go down the lock, turn round and head straight back into the lock and up to continue on our way - which was what we ended up doing.  

Filling the boat up with water takes a really long time and makes you realise just how much water 6 people get through!  

Just alongside the lock there was a Canada Goose sitting on her nest of eggs un-deterred by the passing traffic, but kindly got up to show me her eggs for a photo.

We stopped for the night just along from the Blisworth end of the Blisworth tunnel in beautiful surroundings as seemed to often be the case around the ends of the tunnels as there is a bit more height either side of the Canal.  Laura and I went off into the town to try and find coffee as we were running low and it helps the mornings along, and came across the smell of Fish and Chips wafting through the streets but no sign of a fish and chip shop.  Then a fish and chip van drove past us, so I ended up chasing it through Blisworth until it came to a stop in one of the residential streets (aparently they stop their every week) where finally I could buy some chips and home made fish cakes to supplement our planned omelette dinner.
