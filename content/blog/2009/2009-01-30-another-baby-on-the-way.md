At last our 12 week scan arrived. It had felt like it was a really long way, but it seemed to come round quite quickly once Christmas had gone. So this evening we finally got to see our new little baby, and it was wonderful.




It had been a bit worrying initially as we couldn't find the heartbeat with the doppler we'd rented and the midwife couldn't find it either when she tried on Tuesday. But all the other noises were as expected.




It was really lovely to see our new little baby this evening - seemed to be quite laid back, but did roll round onto his side at one point. Still was quite different in movement to Abi, who was doing backflips at this point!
