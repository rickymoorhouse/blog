Pickup was 11 o'clock so had time to get sorted and have a relaxed morning.  Has an early breakfast watching the clay coloured thrush babies by the restaurant. We then went on the hunt for some ibuprofen which ended up with Laura taking a taxi into La Fortuna.  We checekd out and met our driver to discover that our transfer to Monteverde was no longer going to be taxi-boat-taxi, but instead taxi all the way around the lake.  We stopped at a view point along the way where we could see three volcanoes and local crafts were on sale. The remainder of the journey was very bumpy and pot-holed, but our driver did a great job avoiding and slowing down for them.

We arrived at the [Hotel Belmar](http://hotelbelmar.net) and were given a lemon and verbena welcome drink and told about the hotel and what they had going on there. Their carbon-neutral farm and sustainability ethos sounded fantastic.  We had lunch in the restaurant whilst we waited for our rooms to be ready. I had the Costa Rican Cassado which home-made cheese from the farm, which was delicious.

After lunch we were shown to our beautiful wooden floored and panelled forest rooms with a balcony overlooking the forest and a gorgeous light and spacious bathroom.  We listened to the sounds of the forect for a while and then went for smoothies at the Juice/Tea bar downstairs from our room.  I had the Talemanca which was banana, cacao and coconut. After this we relaxed in our rooms for a bit and I spotted toucanets in a hole in the tree just opposite our room, which we watched for a while and the girls spotted an Agouti on the ground.  Afer this, Abi and I went for nature walk around the hotel before dinner.
