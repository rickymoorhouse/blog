This morning we had a relaxing morning in the pool enjoying the swim-up bar and the views across to the volcano whose peak kept peeping out from behind the clouds. We got wood-fired pizzas for lunch by the pool overlooking the volcano and watching wildlife by the lake.

We were picked up after lunch by Canoa Aventura for our volcano [hike](https://www.strava.com/activities/6993955897), which took us along the course of the 1968 lava flows to a view point where we had great views of the volcano and across to the Arenal Lake. The lake is man-made and covers the area to the west of the volcano which was destroyed by soot and gases from the eruption and is used to generate hydro-electric power.

Along the hike we saw lots of epiphytes, in particular bromeliads and orchids such as the One-day orchid (_Sobralia sp._), the Spanish flag orchid (_Epidendrum radicans_) and the endemic Arenal Bromeliad (_Pitcaimia Funkiae_).

We finished the hike in time to watch the sunset over the lake bathing the volcano in a reddish glow before heading to [Eco Termales](https://ecotermalesfortuna.cr) to bathe in volcanic heated springs under the stars.
