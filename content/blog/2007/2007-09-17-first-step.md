This morning just as I was leaving for work, Abi decided that she wanted to follow me as she often does and came crawling after me towards the front door and peered round it as I opened it and then continued to go through the doorway. At this point Laura picked her up and stood her on the floor a little way back from the doorway. She took a step to the side!! I know it's only a little step but it was a big moment for us and we're very pleased with her!
