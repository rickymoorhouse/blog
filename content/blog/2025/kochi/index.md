I was fortunate to finally get a chance to visit my team in Kochi and had a fantastic few days with them, it was so great to be able to spend some time face to face after working together remotely for several years. I travelled to Kochi via Chennai with British Airways. In Chennai this meant I arrived through the international terminal and then had to clear immigration and head over to the domestic terminal next door.  Immigration all went smoothly but then at the domestic terminal they didn't recognise my boarding pass for the Indigo codeshare that British Airways had given me, so I had to get help at the check in desks. Once this was all resolved I had to pass through security again and all went smoothly, efficient boarding and a short flight later I arrived in Kochi around 9 in the morning and was met by Akhil and Midhun at the airport to take me to the office.

I didn't have very much time to explore Kochi, with arriving on Monday morning and heading back over to Chennai on the Thursday night to spend a day with the team there on Friday but we managed to get away earlier one afternoon and head to the coast - then on the way it poured with rain so we ended up at a nice spot, Old Lighthouse Lounge,  overlooking the coast where we could get some food and drink.

I tried a lot of different foods (whilst sticking to the less spicy options) heading to different places with the team each day I was there - I think my favourite was the local fish wrapped with spices and baked in a banana leaf followed closely by parotta (a flakey layered flatbread) and some of the different paneer based dishes.

There was a real buzz in the office there and it was fantastic seeing the sense of community there and the collaboration that went on within the teams. I managed to have a lot of conversations with different groups across the team, a few one on ones and a couple of full team meetings, but there's lots more that could easily taken another week as the time flew by too quickly. I hope to see them all again soon!
