I had a fantastic few days with the team in Kochi - so great to be able to spend some time face to face after working together remotely for several years

This month, I finally got to spend time with my team in Kochi after several years working together so it was amazing to meet them all face to face and sit down together and chat.

I tried a lot of different foods (whilst sticking to the less spicy options) - I think my favourite was the local fish wrapped with spices and baked in a banana leaf followed closely by parotta (a flakey layered flatbread) and some paneer based dishes.

The time flew by too quickly - hope to see them again soon!
