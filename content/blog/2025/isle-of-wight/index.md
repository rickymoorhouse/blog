Title: Isle of Wight
—-
We decided to take a short family break on the Isle of Wight dung the school Easter holidays. We found accommodation in Yarmouth through Airbnb at a lovely spot overlooking the River Yar. 

On Thursday morning we took the Wight link ferry over to the island in the mining, as we got there early, they put us on the earlier ferry so we arrived to the Isle of Wight just after ten o'clock. We decided to head to Alum bay and spend the day there. We first wat to the viewpoint to see the  needles and then took the stairs down to the bay - as dogs weren't allowed on the chair lift we knew we had to do this both ways!

We found a nice spot on the beach to sit and have our picnic and relax. Nova had a good time exploring around us and found her comfiest spot to sit was on Jess. 

After a relaxing time on the beach we headed back up to the cliff top - nova managed the just set of stairs but wanted to be carried up the bigger set. amAt the top we browsed the shops and had ice creams whilst listening to the live music. We then took the bus across to the Needles battery where we explored the headland and enjoyed the views all around before heading in to see the battery itself. From there you cold see exactly it why was a strategic point to be armed as it overlooked the entrance to the Solent - noone was getting in without passing into its range. We got drinks from the cafe before heading for the bus stop to return to Alum Bay.
