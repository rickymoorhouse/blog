As an experienced operations engineer with a focus on automation and security, I have consistently initiated and led projects resulting in a more proactive approach to potential issues and significant reductions in infrastructure costs. I have experience in cloud development and operations for large highly available SaaS offerings.

# Experience

## IBM United Kingdom Limited — 1999 - present

### Operations Lead, API Connect on IBM Cloud <br />2016 - present

As Operations lead my primary aim is to ensure that the service is available and that the operations team have visibility into the system components. My team provide round the clock operations and support for the API Connect service across all IBM Cloud regions. We collaborate closely with engineers across the performance and development teams to ensure that potential issues are identified and resolved promptly.

### UK Cloud Operations Lead, IBM API Management & Cast Iron Live <br />2013 - 2016

As UK lead I am primarily responsible for ensuring the SaaS offerings continue to operate without issue during the UK business day, leading a team providing operational and customer support and platform improvements. My other responsibilities include providing consultancy to other teams moving to the cloud and working closely with the development teams to ensure a smooth transition from development, through test to production.  
Key projects in this capacity have included the migration of Cast Iron Live from Amazon Web Services to the IBM SoftLayer platform and working with the NetflixOSS components for the IBM API Management SaaS offering.

### Security tooling lead, Software Group UK IT <br /> 2005 - 2011

I was responsible for leading the development and support of internal web based systems used to provide system inventory and security management for Software Group in the UK. Over this time I have gained significant experience in IT Security and System Management, specifically managing the Linux hosting platform with Apache web servers and MySQL databases.

### DB2 Support <br /> 2004 - 2005

Working as part of a small team managing database servers (DB2 and IMS) on z/OS to support the needs of development and test teams across IBM Hursley.

### Anglican Church of Uruguay, Salto, Uruguay <br /> 2003 - 2004

During my leave of absence from IBM, my wife and I went to Uruguay through the South American Mission Society and worked alongside the Anglican Church in there in Salto. This involved working with young people in a poor neighbourhood. As a side project while I was there I set up a website for the diocese.
