![Me](/photos/mount-tam/IMG_8828_hu_8295ea9df23950d9.jpeg) I live in the south of England with my wife, two kids and our dog Nova. By day I'm a Cloud Architect at IBM, working on API Connect. By other times you'll find me running, walking, taking photos, or exploring with family. Welcome to my corner of the web — hope you find something interesting here.
