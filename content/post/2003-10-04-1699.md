We got up early this morning ready to leave with Miguel at 9 o'clock to Espíritu Santo Ô?? we were ready quite early, so I went to get the bread for us all. We went by bus to the church, and when we got there only the workmen were there. Miguel showed us around. Gradually more people arrived to help with the preparations for tomorrow and we joined in helping. We then caught the bus back down to the cathedral to have lunch with Paulo before going to San Esteban. San Esteban is a house where the church looks after people with AIDS and today they had the introductory session of a course about looking after people with AIDS (which was very hard for me to follow, but interesting still).
