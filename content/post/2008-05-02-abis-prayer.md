For a short while when we've been having our morning family devotional time together Abi has been repeating a prayer word by word after me - usually something intended to be like "Thank-you Lord for mummy and daddy" but usually when she's said 'mummy' and I say 'and' she adds 'Abi' but this morning I asked her if she wanted to pray and said 'repeat after me', and she says:




<blockquote>Thank you Lord for work work work
> 
> </blockquote>




Amen
