In the last week, we've had a few of the children round from the barrio, and it's quite interesting to see the differences between them and children back home (in general!). The children that we've had round love to clean and wash up - which I was surprised at. However we had a bag of packaging foam pieces from a parcel that we'd received and they thought that it was sweets or some other type of food - and asked where to buy them.
