Feeling much better today, back into food - Yippee! We've started reading Hebrews together which should be cool. The prayer meeting tonight was at a lady's house across the street, who we didn't know, but vaguely recognised, it was a good meeting and Gilberto talked about changing the Merendero at the church to have more spiritual content. We're going to be looking at a bible story with the kids and one of the others is going to pray at the start each week.
