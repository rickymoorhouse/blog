Using my Raspberry Pi, Piglow and the traffic API feeds I have created a script to give me a visual representation of the journey time to work. This gives me an idea of the traffic before I leave the house in the morning, or so that when I'm working at home I can look at it and see how glad I am that I'm not sitting in traffic on the way to work :)
