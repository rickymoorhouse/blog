title: Reducing our plastic use
---

Over the last few months we've started to try and reduce our use of plastics - especially single use plastics. Here are some of the areas where we've made changes.

## Refillable Splosh cleaning 

Splosh is the great new way to buy essentials like washing up liquid, laundry detergent and surface cleaners. It’s great value, more convenient than the supermarkets and miles better for the environment.You can read all about it here: www.splosh.com.If you use this special code 151F69 when you buy from Splosh you’ll get money off your first order.

## Present wrapping

## Milk bottles

We've started to have milk (and apple juice) delivered by milk and more 
in glass bottles, which can then be returned for reuse.


## Soap instead of shower gel

Another area we seem to end up with a lot of un-necessary plastic is shower gels and shampoos so I've been attempting to reduce this with bar soap.  The soap works well in place of shower gel and also can replace shaving foam but I've not found one thats a good shampoo substitute yet.  The other issue with soaps is a lot of the soaps themselves are packaged in plastic as well so avoiding that is a big part of it - the non-plastic packaged soaps I've found so far are:

 - Lush
 -
