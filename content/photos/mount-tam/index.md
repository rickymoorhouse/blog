I headed up from San Francisco to Mount Tamalpais State Park to explore the area and see some of the sights before heading down to San Jose. I drove through the spectacular scenary of the State Park heading up above the clouds and winding round the mountains to the East Peak car park and then heade out along the Verna Dunshee trail around the peak - the views were amazing and the scenery was spectacular. I then decided to head up to the top along the Plank Walk trail to see the views from up by the fire lookout at 2571 feet.
